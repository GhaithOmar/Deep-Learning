# Deep-Learning

This repository contains:

Full implementation of artificial Neural network from the scratch in the following libraryes: 

1- Numpy
2- TensorFlow
3- Theano

Full implementation of regularization techinque in both Theano and TensorFlow:

1- Batch Normalization 
2- Dropout Regularization 

Full implementation of Adaptive learning rate procedures like RMSprop and Adam

This repository also contains examples of using Keras. 

# Using util.py file

If you want to use the codes you should download the MNIST data set and but it in a folder with the name of large_files
